# TrainAcivity

# Overview
    The TrainActivity is a webpage that uses firebase to store user input and turn it into a train schedule using MomentJs to calculate when the next train is coming in real time.

# How it works
    Google sign in is used on the page. The UI on the main HTML page displays any current train information from the firebase databse on the page and allows the user to input train info to be added to friebase and the page. If the user mouses over any train info a remove icon appears and if clicked on will remove the train from the page and firebase. Comments have been added throughout the javascript code to explain how it works. Materialize API was used in place of bootstrap for styling.
